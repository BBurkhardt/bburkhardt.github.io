# Hi!

I'm a PhD student in computational linguistics at [Heinrich Heine University DÃ¼sseldorf](https://www.uni-duesseldorf.de/home/en/home.html).

I'm currently finishing my dissertation project that I began as a part of Project [A02](https://frames.phil.uni-duesseldorf.de/a02/) of [CRC991](https://frames.phil.uni-duesseldorf.de/). The project was looking into how long distance modification/dependencies can be modelled at the syntax-semantics-inteface given our framework Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG).
